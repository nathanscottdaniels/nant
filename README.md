# pNAnt

### What is it? 

pNAnt is a fork of NAnt that provides parallelization support and fixes some of the more serious shortcomings of NAnt.  You can find the original NAnt project here:

http://nant.sourceforge.net/

and the source here:

# Additions to NAnt

The primary focus of pNAnt is to add the ability to run multiple build targets in parallel.  To this end, several tasks and attributes were added which allow fine-grained control over which targets can be run in parallel and which must be run sequentially.

## Tasks
The following tasks have been added:

* [`<parallel/>`](wiki/parallel--task): Specifies targets to run in parallel
* [`<sequence/>`](wiki/sequence--task): Specifies targets to tun in sequence
* [`<mutex/>`](wiki/mutex--task): Wraps a block of tasks in a mutual-exclusion lock

## Property Scope
No longer are all properties globally scoped.  Properties can now have one of three scopes:
* `global`: Visible to all targets, projects, and threads
* `thread`: Visible to all targets and projects in the current thread and child threads.
* `target`: Visible only to the target in which it is declared.

See the [Property Scope](wiki/property-scope) page for more information.

## Logging Changes
See [Logging Parallel Activities](wiki/logging-parallel-activities) for information on how logging works when dealing with multiple threads.

## Breaking Changes
pNAnt now requires .NET Framework 4.6.  I am sorry.

Any existing NAnt build files will work perfectly fine with pNAnt.

Plugins that were written for NAnt _might_ work without recompilation, however it is unlikely.  Changes were made to the NAnt API that will require any custom tasks or functions to be modified slightly.  No (non-deprecated) functionality was removed but method signatures were changed.
